Most ingestion steps are identical for SigNoz Cloud and self-hosted SigNoz. The main differences are endpoint, authentication, and TLS. Use this page when a doc only shows one environment and you want to adapt it to the other.

## Quick Differences

- Endpoint
  - Cloud: `https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443` (single port for OTLP/HTTP and OTLP/gRPC)
  - Self-Host: `http(s)://<signoz-host>:4317` (gRPC) or `http(s)://<signoz-host>:4318` (HTTP)
- Authentication
  - Cloud: Add header `signoz-ingestion-key: <key>` (or basic auth)
  - Self-Host: No ingestion key; add auth/TLS at your proxy/ingress if you need it
- TLS
  - Cloud: Always TLS on `443`
  - Self-Host: Plain HTTP by default; enable TLS via ingress/reverse proxy for production
- Paths (OTLP/HTTP)
  - Both: SDKs/collectors append `/v1/{traces|metrics|logs}` automatically
- CORS
  - Cloud: Enabled on all endpoints
  - Self-Host: Enable CORS explicitly on the OTLP HTTP receiver if needed

## Cloud to Self-Hosted

Using a guide that only shows SigNoz Cloud steps? Apply the following minimal changes to send data to self-hosted SigNoz:

### Language SDKs

```diff
- OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443
- OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=signoz-ingestion-key=<KEY>
+ OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://<signoz-host>:4317   # or :4318 for HTTP
+ OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE=true                       # set to false when using TLS
+ # No ingestion key header needed
```

Notes:

- If you enable TLS for self-hosted (via ingress/reverse proxy), use `https://<host>:443` and set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE=false` (or omit it) and trust the certificates as needed.
- OTLP/HTTP appends `/v1/{traces|metrics|logs}` automatically when you use the signal-agnostic endpoint variable `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`.

### OpenTelemetry Collector (gateway/agent)

```diff
 exporters:
-  otlphttp:
-    endpoint: https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443
-    headers:
-      signoz-ingestion-key: <KEY>
+  otlp:                       # gRPC (use otlphttp on :4318 if you prefer HTTP)
+    endpoint: <signoz-host>:4317
+    tls:
+      insecure: true         # set to false when you enable TLS/HTTPS
```

If you switch to HTTPS on self-hosted, change the endpoint to `https://<host>:443`, remove `tls.insecure: true`, and add a `tls` block only if you need to trust custom CAs.

## Self-Hosted to Cloud

Using a guide that only shows Self-Hosted steps? Apply the following minimal changes to send data to SigNoz Cloud:

### Language SDKs

```diff
- OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://<signoz-host>:4317   # or :4318 for HTTP
- OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE=true                       # when not using TLS
+ OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443
+ OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=signoz-ingestion-key=<KEY>
+ # Keep your protocol (grpc or http/protobuf); both work on 443
+ # Remove OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE if previously set
```

Notes:

- Keep your current protocol; Cloud supports both OTLP/gRPC and OTLP/HTTP on 443.

### OpenTelemetry Collector (gateway/agent)

```diff
 exporters:
-  otlp:                       # gRPC to self-hosted
-    endpoint: '<signoz-host>:4317'
-    tls:
-      insecure: true
+  otlphttp:
+    endpoint: https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443
+    headers:
+      signoz-ingestion-key: <KEY>
```

Alternative (gRPC): you can also keep `otlp` and set `endpoint: ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443` with `headers: { signoz-ingestion-key: <KEY> }` and no `tls.insecure`.
