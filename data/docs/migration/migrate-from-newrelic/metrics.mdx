title: Migrate Metrics from New Relic
description: Learn how to migrate your application and infrastructure metrics from New Relic to SigNoz using OpenTelemetry.
doc_type: howto
---

## Overview

This guide walks you through migrating metrics from New Relic to SigNoz. You will:

1. Check your New Relic metrics sources
2. Choose the right migration path for each metric source
3. Set up collection in SigNoz
4. Validate that all metrics are flowing correctly

You cannot import historical metrics from New Relic. This guide focuses on redirecting your metric streams to SigNoz going forward.

<KeyPointCallout title="Using self-hosted SigNoz?" defaultCollapsed={true}>
Most steps are identical. To adapt this guide, update the endpoint and remove the ingestion key header as shown in [Cloud → Self-Hosted](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/cloud-vs-self-hosted/#cloud-to-self-hosted).
</KeyPointCallout>

## Key Differences: New Relic vs SigNoz

Before migrating, understand how metric collection differs between the two platforms:

| Aspect | New Relic | SigNoz |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Collection** | Proprietary agents, Prometheus integration | OpenTelemetry Collector, Prometheus Receiver |
| **Data Model** | Dimensional metrics in NRDB | OpenTelemetry metrics model |
| **Query Language** | NRQL | Query Builder, PromQL, ClickHouse SQL |
| **Storage** | NRDB (proprietary) | ClickHouse (open source) |

SigNoz uses open standards (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus) for collection, so your migration involves replacing New Relic agents with OpenTelemetry instrumentation or collectors.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A SigNoz account ([Cloud](https://signoz.io/teams/)) or a running SigNoz instance (Self-Hosted)
- Access to your New Relic account to review current metric sources
- Access to your application code or infrastructure configuration
- Administrative access to deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector (if needed)

## Step 1: Assess Your Current Metrics

Before migrating, create an inventory of what you're collecting in New Relic. This ensures nothing gets lost.

### Export Your Metrics List from New Relic

Run this NRQL query in New Relic's Query Builder to list all metric names:

```sql
SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric SINCE 7 days ago LIMIT MAX
```

For a breakdown by source, run:

```sql
SELECT count(*) 
FROM Metric 
SINCE 7 days ago 
FACET metricName, instrumentation.provider 
LIMIT MAX
```

### Categorize Your Metrics

Group your metrics by source type. Check which of these you're using:

| Source Type | How to Identify | Migration Path |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **OpenTelemetry SDK** | `instrumentation.provider = 'opentelemetry'` | [Redirect OTLP exporter](#from-opentelemetry-sdk) |
| **Prometheus exporters** | You have Prometheus scrapers or remote_write configured | [Use Prometheus Receiver](#from-prometheus-exporters) |
| **New Relic APM agents** | Java, Node, Python, .NET, Ruby, Go, PHP agents installed | [Replace with OTel instrumentation](#from-new-relic-apm-agents) |
| **New Relic Infrastructure** | Host metrics like `SystemSample`, `ProcessSample` | [Use Host Metrics Receiver](#from-new-relic-infrastructure) |
| **AWS CloudWatch** | Metrics prefixed with `aws.*` | [Use SigNoz AWS integration](#from-cloud-integrations) |
| **Azure Monitor** | Metrics prefixed with `azure.*` | [Use SigNoz Azure integration](#from-cloud-integrations) |
| **GCP** | Metrics prefixed with `gcp.*` | [Use SigNoz GCP integration](#from-cloud-integrations) |
| **Synthetics** | Synthetic monitors for uptime/availability | [Use HTTP monitoring](#from-synthetics) |

Save this inventory. You'll use it to validate your migration is complete.

## Step 2: Set Up the OpenTelemetry Collector

Most migration paths require the OpenTelemetry Collector. Set it up first:

1. [Install the OpenTelemetry Collector](https://signoz.io/docs/opentelemetry-collection-agents/get-started/) in your environment.

2. Configure the OTLP exporter to send metrics to SigNoz Cloud

## Step 3: Migrate Each Metric Source

Work through each source type from your inventory.

### From OpenTelemetry SDK

If you're already using OpenTelemetry SDKs with New Relic's OTLP endpoint, redirect to SigNoz:

**Before (New Relic):**
```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://otlp.nr-data.net
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=api-key=<NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY>
```

**After (SigNoz Cloud):**
```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=signoz-ingestion-key=<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>
```

For detailed configuration, see [Migrate from OpenTelemetry to SigNoz](https://signoz.io/docs/migration/migrate-from-opentelemetry-to-signoz/).

### From Prometheus Exporters

If you have Prometheus exporters (node_exporter, application metrics via `/metrics` endpoints), use the Prometheus Receiver:

1. Add the Prometheus receiver to your collector config:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'your-app'
          scrape_interval: 60s
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['localhost:8080']  # Your metrics endpoint
```

2. Enable it in the metrics pipeline:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [prometheus]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

See [Prometheus Metrics in SigNoz](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/prometheus-metrics/) for advanced configuration.

### From New Relic APM Agents

Replace New Relic language agents with OpenTelemetry instrumentation.

**Migration by language:**

| Language | Remove | Add |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Java | `newrelic.jar` agent | [OTel Java Agent](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/opentelemetry-java/) |
| Node.js | `newrelic` npm package | [OTel Node.js SDK](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/opentelemetry-nodejs/) |
| Python | `newrelic` package | [OTel Python SDK](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/opentelemetry-python/) |
| .NET | New Relic .NET agent | [OTel .NET SDK](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/opentelemetry-dotnet/) |
| Go | `go-agent` | [OTel Go SDK](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/opentelemetry-golang/) |
| Ruby | `newrelic_rpm` gem | [OTel Ruby SDK](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/opentelemetry-ruby-on-rails/) |
| PHP | New Relic PHP agent | [OTel PHP SDK](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/opentelemetry-php/) |

**General steps:**

1. Remove the New Relic agent/SDK from your application.
2. Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation following the language-specific guide above.
3. Configure the SDK to export to SigNoz (directly or via Collector).
4. Deploy and verify metrics appear in SigNoz.

### From New Relic Infrastructure

Replace New Relic Infrastructure agent with the OpenTelemetry Collector's Host Metrics Receiver:

1. Add the hostmetrics receiver to your collector config:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
receivers:
  hostmetrics:
    collection_interval: 60s
    scrapers:
      cpu:
      memory:
      disk:
      filesystem:
      load:
      network:
      process:
        include:
          match_type: regexp
          names: ['.*']
```

2. Enable it in the metrics pipeline:

```yaml:otel-collector-config.yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [hostmetrics]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

See [Send Metrics to SigNoz](https://signoz.io/docs/metrics-management/send-metrics/) for more receiver options including Docker, Kubernetes, and process metrics.

### From Cloud Integrations

SigNoz provides native integrations for major cloud providers:

| Provider | Migration Guide |
|----------|-----------------|
| **AWS** | [AWS Cloud Integrations](https://signoz.io/docs/integrations/aws/one-click-aws-integrations/) - One-click setup for CloudWatch metrics |
| **Azure** | [Azure Cloud Integrations](https://signoz.io/docs/azure-monitoring/) |
| **GCP** | [GCP Cloud Integrations](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/) |

These integrations collect the same cloud service metrics you were getting through New Relic.

### From Synthetics

New Relic Synthetics provides scripted browser and API tests. SigNoz offers HTTP endpoint monitoring for availability and latency.

To migrate basic health checks:

1. List your New Relic synthetic monitors
2. Create equivalent HTTP monitors in SigNoz following the [Monitor HTTP Endpoints](https://signoz.io/docs/monitor-http-endpoints/) guide
3. Set up alerts for failures and slow responses

## Validate

Compare your SigNoz metrics against your original inventory to ensure migration is complete.

### Check Metrics Are Arriving

1. In SigNoz, navigate to **Metrics** in the left sidebar.
2. Use the **List View** to browse available metrics.
3. Click a metric name to see its attributes and values.

## Troubleshooting
</ToggleHeading>

### Metrics not appearing in SigNoz

1. **Check Collector status**: Verify the OpenTelemetry Collector is running:
2. **Verify endpoint**: Confirm `https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443` matches your account region.
3. **Check ingestion key**: Ensure `signoz-ingestion-key` header is set correctly.
4. **Test connectivity**: Verify outbound HTTPS (port 443) is allowed to SigNoz Cloud.

### Missing attributes on metrics

If metrics appear but lack expected attributes (like `service.name` or custom dimensions):

1. Check your SDK's resource attribute configuration.
2. Verify no Collector processors are dropping attributes.
3. For Prometheus metrics, ensure labels are being scraped correctly.

### Metric values don't match New Relic

When comparing the same metric in both systems:

1. **Align time ranges**: Ensure both queries cover the exact same period.
2. **Match aggregations**: NRQL and PromQL may use different default aggregations. For example:
3. **Check collection intervals**: Different scrape intervals can cause slight variations.
4. **Verify units**: Some New Relic metrics use different units than OpenTelemetry conventions.
