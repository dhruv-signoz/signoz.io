description: Proactively set up alerts on observability costs and ingestion limits in SigNoz Cost Meter. Avoid surprises and stay in control of your budgets for logs, metrics, and traces.
---

Meter Alerts enable you to monitor and manage your observability costs by creating alert rules for total spend, per-signal spend, or limits by dimensions such as service, environment, or ingestion key. This proactive approach helps you maintain control over your observability budget and identify unexpected cost spikes before they impact your organization.

---

## Why Set Up Meter Alerts?

- **Prevent Budget Overruns:** Receive notifications when costs approach or exceed your budgeted values for a month or specific time window.
- **Monitor Signal Breakdown:** Stay informed about which signals (logs, traces, metrics) or services are driving increased spend.
- **Ensure Fair Usage:** Prevent specific teams, services, or ingestion keys from consuming more than their allocated cost share.
- **Proactive Cost Management:** Take action before costs spiral out of control.

---

## Common Use Cases

- **Total Observability Spend Alert:** Get an alert when your monthly or quarterly observability spend approaches or exceeds your planned budget.
- **Signal-Specific Spend Alert:** Trigger alerts for individual signals when they cross defined thresholds (e.g., log ingestion costs exceeding $X).
- **Service/Environment Spend Alert:** Monitor spend on a per-service or per-environment basis (e.g., alert if 'payment-service' exceeds $X this month).
- **Ingestion Key Limit Alert:** Receive notifications when an ingestion key approaches its allocated quota.

## How Meter Alerts Work

SigNoz Meter Alerts leverage the same flexible alerting engine used for other monitoring signals in SigNoz. Alerts are triggered when a meter metric crosses a specific threshold over a configured evaluation window.

### Alert-Compatible Metrics

You can set up alerts on any of the following meter metrics:

| **Metric**                            | **Description**                         |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `signoz.meter.log.count`              | Total number of log records ingested    |
| `signoz.meter.log.size`               | Total size of logs ingested (in bytes)  |
| `signoz.meter.span.count`             | Total number of spans ingested          |
| `signoz.meter.span.size`              | Total size of spans ingested (in bytes) |
| `signoz.meter.metric.datapoint.count` | Number of metric datapoints ingested    |

Metrics can be filtered or grouped by labels including `service.name`, `deployment.environment`, `host.name`, and `signoz.workspace.key.id` for granular and targeted alerting.

    alt="Create alerts (try new experience)"
    caption="Start by creating a new alert in SigNoz"
  />

- Choose **Metric Based Alerts** as the alert type.

### 2. Select Meter as Your Data Source

- In the signal or metric source dropdown, select `meter` under the **Metrics** signal type.
- From the metrics list, pick the relevant meter metric you want to monitor (such as `signoz.meter.log.size` for total log size, or `signoz.meter.span.count` for span counts).

  <Figure
    src="/img/docs/cost-meter/alerts/navigate-2.png"
    alt="Select Meter source in the dropdown"
    caption="Choose 'meter' under Metrics to see cost-related metrics"
  />

- _(Optional)_ Add filters or groupings using available labels (`service.name`, `deployment.environment`, `signoz.workspace.key.id`, etc.) for targeted alerting at the service, environment, or workspace level.

  <ul>
    <li>
      Examples:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Monitor costs for a specific service: Add <code>service.name: payment-service</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Watch ingestion associated with an environment: Add{' '}
          <code>deployment.environment: production</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

### 3. Configure Alert Thresholds & Evaluation Window

- Define the **condition** for when the alert should trigger:
  - Set a **threshold** (such as a cumulative log size over 1 GB).
  - Choose the aggregation: For most cost/usage monitoring, select **In Total** to aggregate all values within the window.
- Set the **evaluation window**:

  - Select **Cumulative** to monitor total usage for the chosen period.
  - Choose a suitable window (e.g., **Current Day** for daily alerts, **Current Month** for monthly budget limits).

    **Tip:** Meter and billing data in SigNoz always use the UTC timezone. Align your alert windows
    with your organization’s billing/reporting cycle, or use 'Current Month' for monthly quotas.

### 4. Configure Notification Channels

- Attach notification channels of your choice (e.g., Email, Slack, PagerDuty) to receive real-time alerts.
- (Optional) Customize the notification message to provide clear guidance when the alert fires (include context like the service/environment and recommended action).

### 5. Review & Finalize Your Alert

- Give your alert a clear and descriptive name (e.g., "Daily Log Data Budget", "Prod Ingestion Key Quota Exceeded").
- Double-check your query conditions, filters, and notification preferences.
- Click **Save** to activate the alert.

## Examples

### Example 1: Alert for Monthly Log Costs Exceeding $500

- Go to the billing section to find your per-GB log price, which may vary based on your retention settings.

<Figure
  src="/img/docs/cost-meter/alerts/usecase-1.1.png"
  alt="Per GB logs price from billing page"
  caption="Fetch the price of logs (per GB) from billing page"
/>

- In the query builder, select the `signoz.meter.log.size` meter metric and set `timeAggregation` to `Increase` to sum the total log usage.

- Use a formula to convert usage to cost: `(A / 1e9) * (cost per GB)`.

<Figure
  src="/img/docs/cost-meter/alerts/usecase-1.2.png"
  alt="Query for logs ingestion size with formula for calculating the price"
  caption="Query for logs ingestion size with formula for calculating the price"
/>

- Set the alert threshold on this formula with `In Total` aggregation.

- Choose a `Cumulative` window alert with time range set to `Current Month`, and ensure the start date matches your billing cycle as specified on the billing page.

- For accuracy, set the evaluation window to start at `00:00:00` UTC (since billing is calculated in UTC), or pick the corresponding time window in your local timezone.

<Figure
  src="/img/docs/cost-meter/alerts/usecase-1.3.png"
  alt="Threshold condition for monthly log billing"
  caption="Threshold condition for monthly log billing"
/>

- Select your preferred notification channel and save the alert.

### Example 2: Alert for Monthly Total Costs Exceeding $1000

- On the billing page, identify the per-GB price for logs and spans, and the per-million data point price for metrics.

<Figure
  src="/img/docs/cost-meter/alerts/usecase-2.1.png"
  alt="Per GB price for logs and spans, per million data point price for metrics from billing page"
  caption="Per GB price for logs and spans, per million data point price for metrics from billing page"
/>

- In the query builder, select `signoz.meter.log.size` with `timeAggregation` set to `Increase`.

- Additionally, add queries for `signoz.meter.span.size` and `signoz.meter.metric.datapoint.count` with the same aggregation.

- Combine these with a formula to calculate total cost:

  - Logs: `(A / 1e9) * (cost per GB of logs)`
  - Spans: `(B / 1e9) * (cost per GB of spans)`
  - Metrics: `(C / 1e6) * (cost per million data points)`
  - Total: Sum all three components.

<Figure
  src="/img/docs/cost-meter/alerts/usecase-2.2.png"
  alt="Query for total ingestion with formula for calculating the price"
  caption="Query for total ingestion with formula for calculating the price"
/>

- Apply the formula as the threshold condition with `In Total` aggregation.

- Use a `Cumulative` window alert, select `Current Month` as the time range, and set the start date based on your billing cycle.

- Make sure the evaluation window aligns with `00:00:00` UTC, or select the appropriate range for your timezone.

<Figure
  src="/img/docs/cost-meter/alerts/usecase-2.3.png"
  alt="Threshold condition for monthly billing"
  caption="Threshold condition for monthly billing"
/>

- Choose a notification channel and save the alert.

### Example 3: Alert When an Ingestion Key Is Nearing Its Daily Quota

- Go to the ingestion keys page and expand the key you want to monitor.

- Click the `bell` icon next to the daily limit for the relevant signal type.

<Figure
  src="/img/docs/cost-meter/alerts/usecase-3.1.png"
  alt="Ingestion Keys Page for alerting"
  caption="Ingestion Keys Page for alerting"
/>

- You will be redirected to the alerts page with a pre-filled query that includes all the necessary fields.

<Figure
  src="/img/docs/cost-meter/alerts/usecase-3.2.png"
  alt="Query for ingestion key limits based alert"
  caption="Query for ingestion key limits based alert"
/>

- Give the alert a meaningful name, choose a notification channel, and save.

### Example 4: Alert When Any Service Ingests Over 1 Million Spans in a Day

- Select the `signoz.meter.span.count` metric, and add a `group by` for `service.name` to monitor spans per service.

<Figure
  src="/img/docs/cost-meter/alerts/usecase-4.1.png"
  alt="Query for span count per service"
  caption="Query for span count per service"
/>

- Set the threshold to 1,000,000 spans, using `In Total` aggregation.

- Set the evaluation window to `Cumulative` and pick `Current Day` since we are interested in daily usage limits.

<Figure
  src="/img/docs/cost-meter/alerts/usecase-4.2.png"
  alt="Threshold for any service exceeding 1M spans in a day"
  caption="Threshold for any service exceeding 1M spans in a day"
/>

- Configure notifications and save the alert.

## Best Practices

- **Align Alerts with Budgets:** Set alert thresholds just below your actual budget limit to allow time for action.
- **Review Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust alert thresholds and conditions based on changing usage patterns.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **No Meter Data Shown:** Ensure your query time range is larger than 1 hour. Meter data is aggregated hourly.
- **No Alert Triggered:** Confirm your condition and threshold accurately reflect the underlying metric’s scale (bytes, records, spans, etc.).
- **Mismatch with Billing Page?** Meter data in SigNoz is aggregated and displayed using the UTC time zone. If you notice that the usage data shown here does not match exactly with your billing page, ensure you are comparing usage within the **same UTC-aligned period**.
